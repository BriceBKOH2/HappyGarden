Create application-dev.properties in src\main\resources and copy the following text after replacing YOURPASSWORD

spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/HappyGardenDB
spring.datasource.password=YOURPASSWORD
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=create-drop



you can change HappyGardenDB to your database (not recommended)
you can change create-drop to update if you don't want that the database is dropped after killing the application
if you change to update, put // before @EventListener(ApplicationReadyEvent.class) in AdminController to avoid
exception thrown from the method trying to initialising database with existing data (unique contrain problem)

/!\ When you run the application for the first time :
do a Run Configuration...
go to Arguments
in "WM arguments" put : -Dspring.profiles.active=dev
If you run it in command line just add -Dspring.profiles.active=dev at the end.
